This is an sfdx project, so before using it the Salesforce CLI needs to be installed on the local machine. https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli

For development Salesforce supports VS Code. The Apex Extension package should be added for the communication with the server. For using sfdx commands inside the tool, hit ctrl+shift+p.
